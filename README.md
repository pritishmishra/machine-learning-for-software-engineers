## About Video Resources

Some videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. It is free to do so, but sometimes the classes
are no longer in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access. I'm going to be adding more videos
from public sources and replacing the online course videos over time. I like using university lectures.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

This short section were prerequisites/interesting info I wanted to learn before getting started on the daily plan.

- [x] [What is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Data-Analytics-Data-Analysis-Data-Mining-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data-1) | Done | A bit too random now, as there are many answers on this thread 
- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
- [x] [Don’t Break The Chain](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret) | Done | Amazingly simple, yet powerful technique, will be incorporating this as my routine.
- [x] [How to learn on your own](https://metacademy.org/roadmaps/rgrosse/learn_on_your_own):
  - Done
  - Takeaway 1: Learnt about MOOCs from this article. Added a few list of MOOCs for ML here.
  - Takeaway 2: Very well guided about research papers. Go through this once, before going for research papers on ML.
  - Takeaway 3: Parallel Reading? Seems a bit tough, but can give it a try!
  - Takeaway 4: A good introductory note about maths with some useful links. If you are into some serious maths, do check this out!
  - Takeaway 5: Again. Some great links for memory improvement. Should be a good leisure read.
  - Takeaway 6: **[Metacademy](https://metacademy.org)**: A note about this website. Awesome collection of lectures and a treasure trove of concepts. Most of the concepts/lectures are related to ML.

## Machine learning overview
- [x] [A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)
  - Done
  - Excellent visualization
  - This was my resource on ML learning. It introduces and walks through a dataset using classification techiniques.
  - So, gives a very good overview.
- [x] :+1: [A Visual and Interactive Guide to the Basics of Neural Networks](https://jalammar.github.io/visual-interactive-guide-basics-neural-networks)
  - Done
  - An excellent introduction to neural networks
  - Introduces concepts like weight, bias, and gradient descent model
  - Guides how a simple function can be defined for the neutral network.
  - Understanding 3 important concepts: **Feature**, **Weight** and **Bias**
  - Gives a good intro to understand how softmax function is applied.
  - Dig Deeper: Find how to calculate new weights and bias in first few lectures of [Coursera's Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
  - Dig Deeper: [Spotmax function](https://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/classifier/SoftmaxRegression/) -> Very mathematical article. For now, I am just understanding the basic concept and applications of it

## [Advice by BickNowstrom](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=12902244&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D12898718)

- Learn Python stack: scipy, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, jupyter, matplotlib/seaborn.
- Learn machine learning tools: XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Keras, Vowpal Wabbit.
- Do data science competitions: Kaggle, DrivenData, TopCoder, Numerai.
- Take these courses: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning, http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html
- Work on soft skills: Business, management, visualization, reporting.
- Do at least one real-life data science project: Open Data, Journalism, Pet project.
- Contribute to community: Create wrappers, open issues/pull reqs, write tutorials, write about projects.
- Read: FastML, /r/MachineLearning, Kaggle Forums, Arxiv Sanity Preserver.
- Implement: Recent papers, older algorithms, winning solutions.

Note: As a software engineer you have a major advantage for applied ML: You know how to code. AI is just Advanced Informatics. If you want to become a machine learning researcher... skip all this and start from scratch: a PhD. Else: Learn by doing. Only those who got burned by overfit, will know how to avoid it next time.

- Libraries
    - [Keras](https://keras.io) (Beautiful interface to Google Tensorflow and grand-daddy Theano)
    - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) (Similar to Theano, huge ML library, but supporting more than just DL, still in its infancy)
    - [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial) (Evaluate mathematical functions blazingly fast - also on GPUs)
    - [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html) (ML algorithms for preprocessing, model selection, and of course classification, regression, clustering,...)
    - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html) (Vastly duplicative of NumPy, but handy import/export functions)
    - [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference) (Everything vectors and matrices)
    - [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference) (Integration, optimization, interpolation, transformation, and statistics functions on top of NumPy)
    - [SymPy](http://docs.sympy.org/latest) (Do all sorts of symbolic computations like [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) does)
    - [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org) (Visualize "stuff" like NumPy vectors and matrices)
