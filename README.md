## About Video Resources

Some videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. It is free to do so, but sometimes the classes
are no longer in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access. I'm going to be adding more videos
from public sources and replacing the online course videos over time. I like using university lectures.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

This short section were prerequisites/interesting info I wanted to learn before getting started on the daily plan.

## [Advice by BickNowstrom](https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=12902244&how=up&goto=item%3Fid%3D12898718)

- Learn Python stack: scipy, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, jupyter, matplotlib/seaborn.
- Learn machine learning tools: XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Keras, Vowpal Wabbit.
- Do data science competitions: Kaggle, DrivenData, TopCoder, Numerai.
- Take these courses: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning, http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html
- Work on soft skills: Business, management, visualization, reporting.
- Do at least one real-life data science project: Open Data, Journalism, Pet project.
- Contribute to community: Create wrappers, open issues/pull reqs, write tutorials, write about projects.
- Read: FastML, /r/MachineLearning, Kaggle Forums, Arxiv Sanity Preserver.
- Implement: Recent papers, older algorithms, winning solutions.

Note: As a software engineer you have a major advantage for applied ML: You know how to code. AI is just Advanced Informatics. If you want to become a machine learning researcher... skip all this and start from scratch: a PhD. Else: Learn by doing. Only those who got burned by overfit, will know how to avoid it next time.
